\section{Introduction}
Epidemic modelling (EM) is an important tool in epidemiology that uses various mathematical tools to help asses and predict the spread of real world infectious diseases\cite{Sofonea2022sir}. There is a wide range of epidemic models, each using different assumptions about the observed population and the transmission of the disease. This project will study the Susceptible, Infected, Removed (SIR) model. Specifically, we will test how accurate the SIR model is at producing real world infectious disease outbreak patterns across two phases, the early growth phase and the mid stage, close to its peak. This will be accomplished by comparing curves acquired from both the SIR model and real historical data. By applying the SIR model to real outbreaks we can examine where it successfully replicates real patterns and where it fails. Understanding the spread of infectious disease is incredibly relevant to global health. Having a strong understanding of this model is valuable to improving epidemiological predictions and maximizing awareness and prevention. Knowing the SIR model's strengths and limitations ensures correct application for optimal results. We will apply the SIR model to the historical records of both Measles and COVID-19 during specific time periods, as these are two highly contagious and well documented infectious diseases that had significant impacts on public health and societal well being.
\subsection{The SIR Model}
The SIR model is a set of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be used to obtain a stronger understanding of the spread of infectious diseases. The model divides a population into three groups.
\begin{itemize}
    \item\textbf{Susceptible individuals, S(t)}: People in the population that are not infected, but could become infected \cite{cooper2020sir}. 

    \item\textbf{Infected Individuals, I(t)}: People in the population who have been infected by the disease and can then transmit it to other susceptible individuals.

    \item\textbf{Removed individuals, R(t)}: People in the population who have recovered from the disease or who have died\cite{cooper2020sir}.
\end{itemize}
\noindent The SIR model then uses basic assumptions and the rate of change of each of the three groups to acquire the system of ODEs\cite{cooper2020sir}.

\subsubsection{System of ODEs or equation unsure yet}

The population will be referred to as N. where \[N=S+I+R\]
We want to study how the sizes of the cohorts change over time, specifically I(t) which is the size of the infected cohort at a specific time t. To do this we require a set of equations involving the cohorts rates of change.  We treat S,I,R as continuous variables, therefore we can take their rates of change. 
\[\frac{dS}{dt}=-\beta SI\] \ 
\[\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI-\gamma I\] 
\[\frac{dR}{dt}=\gamma I\]

where $\beta$ is the transmitting rate per capita. $\gamma$ is the recovery rate, which implies the mean infectious period is  1/$\gamma$. Initially we will assume everyone is susceptible, so $S(0)= N$. Once an infected individual is introduced to the population the rate which they transmit the disease is $BN$ during the infected period of $1/\gamma$.  Therefore, we can predict the expected number of individuals to be infected by the initial individual  at a rate of $\mathbb{R_0}=\beta N/\gamma$ .   $\mathbb{R_0} $ is titled the basic reproduction number.

The SIR model requires certain assumptions to simplify the population. It assumes homogeneous mixing of both the infected, meaning that everyone in the population has the same probability of  coming in to contact with one and other. The model also assumes a closed population. Therefore, it does not account for births,  relocation, or deaths caused due to factors(JAMA) 

\subsection{Measles data Selection and Training Prediction Split}
The measles outbreak data was collected from Project Tycho, a large open-access data source with millions of records of infectious diseases cases. The timeline and population chosen were January 1st, 1960 to August 21st 1960,  Massachusetts, United states. The SIR model can only describe one outbreak at a time, so the chosen timeline observed is an outbreak observed over  32 weeks.

To properly evaluate the the performance of the SIR models predictions we were required to pick a training period. The first five weeks were used for the estimations of the SIR model's parameters and to capture the early growth phase of this outbreak. The rest of the weeks were used to assess the models ability to predict the timing and magnitude of the outbreak's peak. For if the remaining weeks are used in the models training it will not predict the peak, it will simply have been shown it.
