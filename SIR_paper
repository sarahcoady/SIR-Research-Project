{\LARGE Evaluating the Accuracy of the SIR Model in Replicating Real-World Disease Outbreaks}
\end{center}

\vspace{2cm}
\noindent Epidemic modeling (EM), uses mathematics to study the spread of infectious diseases. There are various different epidemic models used in EM, we chose to study the SIR model. The SIR model divides a population into three cohorts, Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered and models the rate of change of each cohort. We studied how accurately the SIR model could replicate the outbreak patterns of measles and COVID-19, by comparing it to observed data. We concluded that the SIR model performed best when the disease had a lower $R_0$ value, most likely due to the assumptions the SIR model makes about the population.

\section{Introduction}
Epidemic modelling (EM) is an important tool in epidemiology that uses various mathematical tools to help assess and predict the spread of real world infectious diseases\cite{Sofonea2022sir}. There is a wide range of epidemic models, each uses different assumptions about the observed population and the transmission of the disease. This project will study the Susceptible, Infected, Removed (SIR) model. Specifically, we will test how accurate the SIR model is at producing real world infectious disease outbreak patterns across two phases, the early growth phase and the mid stage, close to its peak. This will be accomplished by comparing curves acquired from both the SIR model and real historical data.  Understanding the spread of infectious disease is incredibly relevant to global health.  A strong understanding of this model is valuable for improvement of epidemiological predictions and maximizing awareness and prevention. Knowing the SIR model's strengths and limitations ensures correct application for optimal results. We will apply the SIR model to the historical records of both measles and COVID-19 during specific time periods, as these are two highly contagious and well documented infectious diseases that had significant impacts on public health and societal well being.
\section{Methods}
\subsection{The SIR Model}
The SIR model is a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be used to obtain a stronger understanding of the spread of infectious diseases. The model divides the studied population into three groups, which will be referred to as cohorts.
\begin{itemize}
    \item\textbf{Susceptible individuals, S(t)}: People in the population that are not infected, but could become infected \cite{cooper2020sir}. 

    \item\textbf{Infected individuals, I(t)}: People in the population who have been infected by the disease and can then transmit it to other susceptible individuals.

    \item\textbf{Removed individuals, R(t)}: People in the population who have recovered from the disease or who have died\cite{cooper2020sir}.
\end{itemize}
\noindent The SIR model then uses basic assumptions and the rate of change of each of the three groups to acquire the system of ODEs\cite{cooper2020sir}.


\subsubsection{System of ODEs}

The population will be referred to as N. where \[N=S+I+R\]
We want to study the weekly and daily incidences of measles and COVID-19, respectively. To do this, we require a set of equations involving each cohort's rate of change.  While I(t) shows the actual number of individuals infected at a given time, the historical, observed data contains solely the weekly and daily reported cases.  Therefore, we were required to convert the SIR model to weekly incidence. We treat S,I,R as continuous variables, therefore we can take their rates of change.
\[\frac{dS}{dt}=-\beta SI\] \ 
\[\frac{dI}{dt} = \beta SI-\gamma I\] 
\[\frac{dR}{dt}=\gamma I\]

\noindent$\beta$ is the transmission rate per capita. $\gamma$ is the recovery rate. The mean infectious period is  1/$\gamma$. Initially we will assume everyone is susceptible, so $S(0)= N$. Once an infected individual is introduced to the population the rate which they transmit the disease is $BN$ during the infected period of $1/\gamma$.  Therefore, we can predict the expected number of individuals to be infected by the initial individual at a rate of $R_0=\beta N/\gamma$.   $R_0$ is titled the basic reproduction number\cite{brauer2008}
The SIR model requires population assumptions. The model assumes homogeneous mixing, meaning that everyone in the population has the same probability of coming into contact with one and other. The model also assumes a closed population. Therefore, it does not account for births,  relocation, or deaths caused due to factors unrelated to the disease\cite{Tolles2020}. 

\subsection{Measles Data Selection}
The measles outbreak data was collected from Project Tycho\cite{ProjectTycho}, a large open-access data source with millions of records of infectious diseases cases. The timeline and population chosen were January 1st to August 21st 1960,  Massachusetts, United states. The SIR model can only describe one outbreak at a time, so the chosen timeline observed is an outbreak that occurred over approximately 32 weeks. Once the data was collected we were able to produce a plot. Figure\ref{fig:measlesob} depicts the observed incidence of measles during the outbreak period. Looking at Figure\ref{fig:measlesob} a relatively smooth exponential growth can be seen from weeks 1 to 15. Weeks 15 to 20 show the peak of the outbreak where the case value reached a maximum of 1214. After week 20 the Figure shows a relatively steady decrease in weekly cases, implying individuals were moving from the infected cohort to the recovered cohort. The trajectory this plot takes depicts a very standard outbreak. 

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{observed.png}
    \caption{Measles Observed}
    \label{fig:measlesob}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Initial Conditions}
Once we had the observed incidence of the chosen measles outbreak, we then implemented the SIR model. To do so, we required initial conditions and model parameters. The $R_0$ value for measles has been cited to be within the range of 12 to 18\cite{Guerra2017}. We chose to run the SIR model three times, each using a different $R_0$ value. This allowed us to study the effects $R_0$ had on the model.  We chose, $R_0=12$, $R_0=15$, and $R_0=18$ to cover the cited range. 
After observing that this range of cited $R_0$ values did not replicate accurate patterns of the observed curve, we ran the model with values outside of the range to study if lower $R_0$ values has a positive effect on the shape of the modeled curve.

Next, $N$ was chosen. As stated previously, the SIR model assumes homogeneous mixing within a population. Therefore, we chose to make $N$ an effective population, meaning a smaller population size that would experience a similar rate of the infectious spread as the actual infected population. Realistically the outbreak we are studying happened within a smaller community within Massachusetts where homogeneous mixing was more likely.

Then we required an $I(0)$ value. The SIR model studies when a population is exposed to an infectious disease and its spread form cohort to cohort. Therefore, the initial $I(0)$ value can not be equal to zero, we must start with a small number of infected individuals. We chose $I(0)=3$ along with $R(0) = 0$. Once these values were selected, we were able to calculate $S(0)$ using: \[S_0 = N - I(0) - R(0)\]

\subsubsection{Model Parameters}
We  required the model's parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$. $\gamma$ is the infectious period, not the full time of recovery from the disease. For measles the infectious period is cited to be approximately 7-10 days\cite{canada2016}. With this given range we choose our $\gamma$ rate to be $0.875$ per week. With our chosen $R_0$ and $\gamma$ we could then calculate $\beta$.


\subsubsection{Implementing the SIR Model}

A SIR model usually consists of S, I, and R curves. However, the SIR model describes what is happening in a moment in time, how many individuals are currently susceptible, infected, and recovered, whilst the observed data shows how many  cases there are each week or day. Therefore, we had to convert the SIR model's output into weekly incidence for measles and daily incidence for COVID-19. To do this we had to examine the Susceptible cohort at the beginning and end of each week. As the disease spreads throughout the population the size of the Susceptible cohort decreases, more individuals become infected. Thus, the change in size of the Susceptible cohort is the amount of individuals who are infected each week/day. All of this was done using a python code.

\subsection{COVID-19 Data Selection}
The COVID-19 data was also collected from project Tycho\cite{ProjectTycho}.  The COVID-19 data was provide in daily case counts. We chose to plot March 14th to April 7th, 2020 in Los Angeles, United States. The observed case count curve is depicted in Figure\ref{fig:COVID observed}. Similar to the measles data the early phase shows exponential growth for the beginning days, then reaches a peak of  3600 cases. This outbreak then had an abrupt drop in cases, this is likely due to an inaccurate case count, or large number of failed reported cases. This outbreak was chosen because it contains the two phases being studied. Many of the COVID-19 outbreaks  start with a large quantity of individuals infected, leaving the resulting plots lacking a clear early exponential growth phase.





\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{image10.png}
    \caption{COVID-19 Observed}
    \label{fig:COVID observed}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Initial Conditions for COVID-19}
To implement the SIR model for COVID-19 we required initial conditions and parameters.  The $R_0$ for COVID-19 is cited to be between 1.4 and 2.5\cite{Viceconte2020}. Though some journals have cited the range to be larger, this is the range we have studied. To stay consistent with our measles data we chose to run the model with three different $R_0$ values of $R_0=1.4$, $R_0= 2.0$, and $R_0=2.5$. We chose the same population size of $N=5000$, again not meaning to represent the total population of  the city, but an effective population that replicates a population with possible homogeneous mixing. The same $I(0) = 3$  was chosen for the COVID-19 model.

\subsubsection{COVID-19 Model Parameters}
The infectious period for COVID-19 is cited to be approximately 7 days\cite{NSHealthCOVID}. Using this approximation we valued our  $\gamma$ at 0.143 per day. Using both $R_0$ and $\gamma$ we could calculate $\betta$. The COVID-19 data was provided in daily cases, so the SIR model had to be converted to daily incidence, instead of weekly. 

\section{Results}
\subsection{Measles}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{r0=12.png}
    \caption{Measles $R_0 = 12$}
    \label{$R_0 = 12$}
\end{figure}

Figure\ref{$R_0 = 12$} shows the implemented SIR model for measles with an $R_0 = 12$. This curve looks drastically different from that of the observed curve. In the first week the case value immediately reaches its peak, then rapidly decreases around week two. By week five the case count reaches zero and stays constant for the remaining weeks. It is evident based on this curve that that SIR model did not adequately produce the observed data's pattern.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{R_0=15.png}
    \caption{Measles $R_0 = 15$}
    \label{fig:$R_0 = 15$}
\end{figure}

Figure\ref{fig:$R_0 = 15$} shows the implemented SIR model for measles with an $R_0 = 15$. This plot's trend is virtually identical to the plot of $R_0 = 12$. The noticeable differences being that the peak case value was higher, with it being approximately 5,000 cases compared to the $R_0 = 12$ peak of approximately 4,700. The $R_0 = 15$ case values post week one, decreased more rapidly with the case value almost at zero immediately after the first week.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{R_0=18.png}
    \caption{Measles $R_0 = 18$}
    \label{fig:$R_0 = 18$}
\end{figure}

Figure\ref{fig:$R_0 = 18$} was the least comparable to the observed data out of the three plots. The peak case value is the greatest of them all. The peak starts immediately at week one and by week two completely drops to zero. Though none of the three plots accurately represented the observed curve, what became clear is the smaller the $R_0$ value the better the SIR model performed. With this in mind we then attempted values outside of the cited range to see if we could obtain a more accurate plot.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{R=2.png}
    \caption{lowered $R_0$}
    \label{fig:R_0 = 2}
\end{figure}

\noindent In Figure\ref{fig:R_0 = 2} we lowered the $R_0$ value significantly to $R_0= 2$, far out of the measles cited range. With such a low value this plot no longer represents an epidemic curve for measles, however, it does show a far more realistic shape. The curve has a rapid growth over the first weeks, reaches a clear peak, and then rapidly decreases to zero. This pattern is similar to that of the observed outbreak curve. This makes it clear that the SIR model better replicates an epidemic curve when it has a lower $R_0$ value. Measles is cited to have one of the highest $R_0$ values of all infectious diseases. This suggests that the SIR model, under homogeneous mixing and constant parameters struggles to produce observed measles outbreak. We then look at the results of COVID-19, an infectious disease with a much lower $R_0 $ value. 

\subsection{COVID-19}

Figure\ref{fig:1.4} shows the implemented SIR model for COVID-19 with an $R_0=1.4$. This curve shows a steady slow growth, the cases increase exponentially for a long period of time and there is no peak within the observation window. Figure\ref{fig:R0=2.0} is the SIR model with an $R_0=2.0$. This plot has a slower growth, where the cases increase exponentially. The plot begins to reach a peak, but does not fully reach it during the time period. Figure\ref{fig:2.5} depicts the SIR model with an $R_0 = 2.5$. This plot has a fast exponential growth. The peak occurs earlier than the previous plots and can be seen around day 42, then the case count decreases. Though the SIR model had a longer observational window than the observed data, we can still compare the overall patterns of the models to the observed data. Each plot did a relatively good job at depicting the exponential growth phase, unlike measles every plot displayed this. The SIR model with the $R_0=2.5$ had a relatively accurate pattern of exponential growth to the observed data. Unlike the others this plot also shows a peak which happens later in the curve, much like the observed outbreak. The SIR model will always output a smooth curve, it does not matter what disease is modeled. Because the model is a system of continuous ODEs, it also assumes average behavior of the entire population and does not account for any randomness or reporting delays. Therefore the model can not produce the dips and spikes we see in the observed data. Our comparison of the models and the observed data is on qualitative agreement in the outbreak patterns and not matching the exact daily case counts.

\end{figure}

    \caption{COVID-19 R=1.4}
    \label{fig:1.4}
\end{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{image2.png}
    \caption{COVID-19 $R_0=2.0$}
    \label{fig:R0=2.0}
\end{figure}

\section{Limitations}

The SIR model is a very simple and idealized epidemic model. We stated that the model assumes a closed population with homogeneous mixing, which is unrealistic. This assumption is a limitation to the SIR model. This then forced us to use a smaller population size in our model, which could definitely impact the outputted results. We also assumed an I(0) value, along with a $\gamma$ value which was taken from a provided range, all of which could alter the SIR model's output. The SIR model also outputs a constant curve with no dips or fluctuations in the case values, which is unrealistic.  We are also comparing the models to observed cases where there are issues of under reported cases.

\section{Conclusion}
The SIR models for measles, did not display accurate outbreak patterns. Whereas, the COVID-19 curves did. We believe this is due to the large difference in their $R_0$ values. The assumption of the effectiveness of the model based on its basic reproduction value is reasonable with the population assumptions made. A disease with a high  basic reproduction value, means one infected individual will infect more persons than that of an infected individual with a lower value. When we assume a closed homogeneous population, we are assuming the population size is not changing and everyone in the population has equal probability of coming into contact with one another. This aligns with the SIR model for measles showing the instant spike in infected individuals. If one person can infect 18 individuals, all of whom have equal probability of coming into contact, it would likely not take long for everyone to be infected. The plots for COVID-19 showed exponential growth and a peak. On average, one individual infected 1.4 to 2.5 individuals which appeared to allow the SIR model to depict realistic outbreak patterns. These results suggest that the $R_0$ value has a large impact on the accuracy of the SIR model. Based on these results we would conclude that the SIR model can be used for diseases with a lower basic reproduction value, but is not effective for diseases with an increased value. Though it is important to be aware that the model can give a general idea of an outbreak pattern, it should certainly not be the sole model used due to its generalizations.
