\section{Introduction}
\newpage
Epidemic modelling is a highly important tool used in epidemiology. Epidemic modelling uses various mathematical tools to help study and predict the spread of real world infectious diseases (NLM). We plan to study the SIR model. Specifically, we will test how accurate the SIR model is at producing real world infectious disease outbreak patterns, by comparing it to historical data.
